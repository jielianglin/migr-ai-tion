      <h3>Project Description</h3>
      <p>
        [Migr-ai-tion.net] is an applied, interdisciplinary research project
        that investigates the potentials of AI as a participatory and
        therapeutic medium to work with the digital diaspora. Situated at the
        nexus of migration studies, media and future anthropology and
        speculative design, the project tackles issues such as data colonialism
        in computer vision, stereotypes, marginalization, collective trauma and
        agency.  The platform will collect and map a collaborative image
        dataset, uploaded by users worldwide for training future computer vision
        technologies challenging mainstream representations of migrant
        experiences.
